**2\. Role and Scope of Processing**

**2.1 Scope.** This European DPA applies to the processing of School Personal Data that is subject to European Data Protection Laws by Clever for the purpose of providing the Services in its capacity as a Processor. This European DPA does not apply to Personal Data that Clever may process as a Controller or Personal Data that you may process via third-party websites or services (including but not limited to applications made available by Developers).

**2.2 Details of Processing.** The subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of the Processing, as well as the types of Personal Data processed and categories of Data Subjects, are described inSchedule 1to this European DPA.

**2.3 Processing Relationship.** You acknowledge that with regard to the processing of School Personal Data, you are the Controller and Clever is your Processor under European Data Protection Laws. You acknowledge that Clever may disclose this European DPA and any relevant privacy provisions in the Agreement to a Supervisory Authority, or any other European or US judicial or regulatory body upon their request.

**2.4 School Responsibilities.** You will, in your use of the Services: (a) be responsible for determining whether the Services are appropriate for the processing and storage of School Personal Data under European Data Protection Laws; (b) comply with your obligations as a Controller under European Data Protection Laws and ensure that your instructions to Clever are lawful and comply with European Data Protection Laws; and (c) have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of School Personal Data and the means by which you acquired School Personal Data.

**2.5 Notice and Consent.** You represent and warrant that you have obtained all consents, permissions and rights necessary for Clever, and its Affiliates and Sub-processors, to lawfully process School Personal Data for the purposes contemplated by the Agreement, and (where necessary) that you have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents.

**3\. Processing of School Personal Data**

**3.1 Processing Instructions.** Clever will process School Personal Data only in accordance with your lawful documented instructions and will not process School Personal Data for its own purposes, except where required by applicable laws. The Agreement, including this European DPA, along with your configuration of any settings or options in the Services, constitute your complete and final instructions to Clever regarding the processing of School Personal Data (including for purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses). Clever shall promptly notify you if it determines that your instructions infringe European Data Protection Laws, but without obligation for Clever to actively monitor your compliance with European Data Protection Laws.

**3.2 Confidentiality of processing.** Clever will ensure that any person it authorizes to process School Personal Data is subject to an appropriate duty of confidentiality (whether a contractual or statutory duty) and that they process School Personal Data only as necessary for the purpose of delivering the Services.

**3.3 Security.** Clever will implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures with the aim of protecting School Personal Data from Personal Data Breaches. At a minimum, such measures will include the measures set out in **Schedule 2** ("**Security Measures**"). You acknowledge that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Clever may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not degrade or diminish overall security of the Services.

**3.4 Personal Data Breaches.** In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Clever will inform you without undue delay and provide you with written details of the Personal Data Breach, including the type of data affected and the identity of affected Data Subjects, once such information becomes known or available to Clever. Clever will, to the extent possible, provide you with timely information and cooperation to enable you to fulfil your data breach reporting obligations under European Data Protection Laws and will take reasonable steps to remedy or mitigate the effects of the Personal Data Breach.

**3.5 Audit Rights.** Upon request, Clever will provide copies of any certifications, audit report summaries and/or other relevant documentation it possess, where reasonably required by you to verify Clever's compliance with this European DPA. While it is the parties' intention ordinarily to rely on such certifications, audit report summaries and/or other documentation to verify Clever's compliance with this European DPA (including the Standard Contractual Clauses), following a confirmed Personal Data Breach or where a Supervisory Authority requires it, you may provide Clever with thirty (30) days' prior written notice requesting that a third-party conduct an audit of Clever's operations and facilities ("**Audit**") provided that (i) any Audit will be conducted at your expense, (ii) the parties shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing and duration of the Audit, (iii) the Audit shall not unreasonably impact Clever's regular operations, and (iv) you will not have access to any files or systems that could result in the exposure of confidential information of other customers of Clever. Any certifications, audit report summaries and/or other relevant documentation provided by Clever, and the findings of any Audit, will be subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Agreement.

**3.6 Requests by Public Authorities.** If Clever receives a valid and binding subpoena, warrant, order or other legally binding request ("**Request**") from a law enforcement or other government authority ("**Requesting Party**") for disclosure of School Personal Data, Clever will use all reasonable efforts to redirect the Requesting Party to request School Personal Data directly from you. If Clever is compelled to disclose School Personal Data to a Requesting Party, Clever will promptly notify you of the Request to allow you to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, if you are legally permitted to do so. If Clever is prohibited from notifying you about the Request, Clever will use reasonable and lawful efforts to obtain a waiver of prohibition to allow Clever to communicate as much information to you as soon as possible. If Clever is prohibited from notifying you, Clever agrees to review, under the laws of the country of destination, the legality of the Request, notably whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority and exhaust all available remedies to challenge the request if, after a careful assessment, Clever concludes that there are grounds under the laws of the country of destination to do so. This includes requests under section 702 of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ("**FISA**"). When challenging a request, Clever shall seek interim measures with a view to suspend the effects of the request until the court has decided on the merits. Clever shall not disclose or provide access to the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules and, at such time, shall provide only the minimum amount of information required to comply with the request, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

**3.7 Sub-processors.** You grant Clever a general authorization to engage Sub-processors, including those Sub-processors listed [here](/trust/subprocessors) (or such other successor URL) ("Sub-processor List") and Clever will:

*   (a) notify you in the event of the engagement of any new or replacement Sub-processor, including updating the Sub-processor List;
*   (b) impose substantially the same data protection terms on any Sub-processor it engages as contained in this European DPA (including data transfer provisions, where applicable); and
*   (c) remain liable for any breach of this European DPA caused by an act, error or omission of its Sub-processors.

**3.8 Objection to Sub-processors.** You may object to Clever's appointment of any new or replacement Sub-processor in writing within ten (10) days after receiving notice in accordance with Section 3.7 and on reasonable grounds related to the Sub-processor's ability to ensure compliance with this European DPA. In such case, we will discuss your concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If we cannot reach such resolution, Clever will have the right, at its sole discretion, to either not appoint the disputed Sub-processor or allow you to suspend or terminate the Agreement. In the event you terminate the Agreement, Clever will refund to you a pro rata share of any prepaid fees for the remaining and unexpired portion of the Services. This will be your exclusive remedy and Clever's entire liability for resolving objections to Clever's appointment of Sub-processors under this European DPA.

**3.9 Cooperation and Data Subject Requests.** Clever will reasonably cooperate to enable you to respond to any requests, complaints or other communications from Data Subjects, Supervisory Authorities or other regulatory or judicial bodies relating to the processing of School Personal Data by Clever, including requests from Data Subjects seeking to exercise their rights under European Data Protection Laws. In the event that any such request, complaint or communication is made directly to Clever, Clever will pass on the request to you and will not respond directly without your express authorization (unless required to do so in order to comply with applicable law(s)).

**3.10 Data Protection Impact Assessments.** To the extent required under European Data Protection Laws, Clever will provide you with reasonable assistance (at your cost) with conducting data protection impact assessments and consulting with Supervisory Authorities in respect of any proposed processing activity that presents a high risk to Data Subjects.

**3.11 Deletion.** Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, and at your election, Clever will delete or return all School Personal Data in Clever's possession in accordance with the Agreement and Clever's then-current data deletion timelines and policies. This requirement will not apply to the extent that Clever is required by applicable law(s) to retain some or all of the School Personal Data or to School Personal Data archived on back-up systems, in which event Clever shall isolate and protect such School Personal Data from any further processing except to the extent required by such law. You agree that the certification of deletion described in Clauses 8.5 and 16(d) of the Standard Contractual Clauses will be provided by Clever only upon your written request.

**4\. International Data Transfers**

**4.1 Processing Location.** Clever may transfer and process School Personal Data in the United States and any other country in which Clever, Clever Subsidiaries and Sub-processors maintain processing facilities. Clever will not transfer or process School Personal Data (nor permit such data to be transferred or processed) outside Europe unless it first takes such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with applicable European Data Protection Laws and this European DPA.

**4.2 Standard Contractual Clauses.** To the extent that the transfer of School Personal Data from School to Clever involves a Restricted Transfer, the Standard Contractual Clauses included at **Schedule 3** shall be incorporated and form an integral part of this European DPA with School (and any School Affiliates) as the "data exporter" and Clever as the "data importer". In the event that any provision of this European DPA contradicts, directly or indirectly, the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail. For School Personal Data that is subject to the UK GDPR, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be modified in accordance with the UK Addendum included at **Schedule 4**, which shall also be incorporated and form an integral part of this European DPA

**4.3 Alternative Transfer Mechanism.** If Clever adopts an alternative lawful data export mechanism for the transfer of personal data not described in this European DPA ("**Alternative Transfer Mechanism**"), the Alternative Transfer Mechanism will apply instead of any applicable transfer mechanism described in this European DPA (but only to the extent such Alternative Transfer Mechanism complies with European Data Protection Laws and extends to the countries to which the relevant School Personal Data is transferred).

## SECTION II - OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

### _Clause 8_

**Data protection safeguards**

The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.

**8.1 Instructions**

(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.

(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.

**8.2 Purpose limitation**

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.

**8.3 Transparency**

On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

**8.4 Accuracy**

If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.

**8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data**

Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).

**8.6 Security of processing**

(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter "personal data breach"). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.

(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.

(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.

**8.7 Sensitive data**

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person's sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter "sensitive data"), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.

**8.8 Onward transfers**

The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter "onward transfer") if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:

(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;

(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;

(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or

(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.

Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.

**8.9 Documentation and compliance**

(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.

(b) The Parties will be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.

(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter's request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.

(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.

(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

### _Clause 9_

**Use of sub-processors**

(a) The data importer has the data exporter's general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors in accordance with Section 3.6 of this European DPA to which these Clauses are appended, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.

(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.

(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter's request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.

(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor's obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.

(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby - in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent - the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.

### _Clause 10_

**Data subject rights**

(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data exporter.

(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects' requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance will be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.

(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.

### _Clause 11_

*   (i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;
*   (ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.

(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

### _Clause 13_

**Supervision**

(a) Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State: The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679: The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679: The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.

## SECTION III - LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

### _Clause 14_

**Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses**

(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.

(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:

*   (i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;
*   (ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination- including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities - relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;
*   (iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.

(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.

(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).

(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter will be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.

### _Clause 15_

**Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities**

**15.1 Notification**

(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:

*   (i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or
*   (ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.

(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.

(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authorities, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).

(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent suspensory authority on request.

(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.

**15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation**

(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).

(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

## SECTION IV - FINAL PROVISIONS

### _Clause 16_

**Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination**

(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.

(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).

(c) The data exporter will be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:

*   (i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;
*   (ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
*   (iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.

(g) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.

(h) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

### _Clause 17_

**Governing law**

These Clauses will be governed by the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such law allows for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this will be the laws of Ireland.

### _Clause 18_

**Choice of forum and jurisdiction**

(a) Any dispute arising from these Clauses will be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.

(b) The Parties agree that those will be the courts of Ireland.

(c) A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of the Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.

(d) The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.

### Amendments to this Addendum

16\. The Parties may agree to change Clauses 17 and/or 18 of the Addendum EU SCCs to refer to the laws and/or courts of Scotland or Northern Ireland.

*   b. its risk under the Addendum,

and in either case it has first taken reasonable steps to reduce those costs or risks so that it is not substantial and disproportionate, then that Party may end this Addendum at the end of a reasonable notice period, by providing written notice for that period to the other Party before the start date of the revised Approved Addendum.

20\. The Parties do not need the consent of any third party to make changes to this Addendum, but any changes must be made in accordance with its terms.
