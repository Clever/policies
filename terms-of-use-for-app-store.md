  <p>
  <em>Effective Date: November 1, 2021</em>
  </p>
  <p>
  Welcome to Clever’s Additional Terms of Use for the Clever App Store (the “Additional Terms for the Clever App Store”). If you are a School and are using the Clever App Store, please also review our [General Terms of Use](general-terms-of-use.md), the [Additional Terms of Use for Schools](terms-of-use-for-schools.md) and our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md). Capitalized terms that are not defined below have the definitions given them in the General Terms of Use and Additional Terms of Use for Schools.
  </p>
  <p>
  These Additional Terms of Use for the Clever App Store apply to your use of the Clever App Store, an online application marketplace where Developers can offer to sell subscriptions to their software applications (each a “Developer App”) and Clever can offer to sell subscriptions of its software applications (each a “Clever App”) for direct distribution to Schools through our Services.
  </p>
  <h3>
    A. END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
  </h3>
  <p>
  Your use of any Developer App made available in the Clever App Store is subject to the end user license agreement or other contract that you agree to with the applicable Developer. It is also subject to the Developer’s privacy policy, which we recommend requesting and reviewing carefully before purchasing any Developer App. Clever does not have any liability under any contract between you and a Developer or for any breach by you or the Developer of any of the terms of any such contract. Further, Clever does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information made available in the Clever App Store relating to the Developer Apps.
  </p>
  <p>
  Your use of any Clever App made available in the Clever App Store is also subject to any additional terms that you agree to as part of the process of purchasing the Clever App.
  </p>
  <h3>
    B. PAYMENT OF SUBSCRIPTION FEES
  </h3>
  <p>
  You agree to pay Developers directly for your use of Developer Apps made available in the Clever App Store and to pay Clever directly for your use of Clever Apps made available in the Clever App Store. Clever may permit you to make payments via a third-party payment processor in the Clever App Store, but is not required to do so. Clever has no obligation to track or process payments, authenticate paid or previously paid downloads, maintain payment records, or pay, report, or charge or collect sales, excise, value-added, or similar taxes. Note that Clever may separately require Developers to pay Clever to post their Developer Apps in the Clever App Store.
  </p>
  <h3>
    C. MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT
  </h3>
  <p>
  Clever has no obligation to provide any maintenance and support services with respect to the Developer Apps. If a Developer App does not perform as expected, please raise your concerns directly with the applicable Developer. To the extent permitted by law, Clever makes no warranties with respect to the Developer Apps, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by your contract with the applicable Developer. Clever has the right to refuse to include any Developer App and/or associated content on the Clever App Store. In addition, Clever may, at any time, in its sole discretion and without notice, take down or remove any Developer App or associated content from the Clever App Store.
  </p>
  <h3>
    D. REFUNDS AND CLAIMS
  </h3>
  <p>
  You agree that Clever is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the Developer Apps or your possession and/or use of the Developer Apps, including, but not limited to: (i) refunds or charge backs; (ii) product liability claims; (iii) any claim that a Developer App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iv) claims arising under consumer protection laws or similar laws. In the event you seek a refund or have a charge back claim, the Developer will be solely responsible for the refund of fees to you, if any, or to resolve any charge back claims. Further, if any third-party claims that a Developer App infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights, the Developer, not Clever, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by your contract with the applicable Developer.
