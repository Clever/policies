# Canadian Privacy Notice

Effective Date: June 30, 2022

This Privacy Notice for Canadian Residents ("Canadian Notice") supplements the Clever [Privacy Policy](/trust/privacy/policy) as well as any other agreement you may have with us. Any terms we use in this Canadian Notice that aren"t defined will have the meaning we provide in the Privacy Policy or other agreements.

**International Data Transfers.** We are based in the United States and any information collected through the Services is stored and processed in the United States. If you are located in Canada, you understand that in using the Services your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries where our third-party service providers and partners operate. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective.

**Profiling Activities.** Clever uses standard tracking technologies like cookies to distinguish you from other users and to collect certain information about how you use and interact with the Services (as described in our [Privacy Policy](/trust/privacy/policy)). This helps us to provide you with a positive user experience and allows us to provide and improve our Services. For more information about the types of tracking technologies we use and how you can control them, please see our Cookie Notice [here](/trust/privacy/cookies).

**Schools.** If we have collected and use your personal information at the direction of and under the control of a School then we process your personal information as a processor. If this is the case, the School is the controller responsible for your personal information and you should contact that School if you have any privacy-related questions or concerns about their privacy practices.

**Your Rights and Choices.** You may be able to exercise certain rights with respect to your personal information that we collect and control:

*   **Access.** You may ask us in writing whether we have collected personal information about you and to obtain access to that personal information.
    
*   **Correction.** If you believe the personal information we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you can ask us to correct it.
    
*   **Deletion.** We will delete personal information when we no longer have a lawful basis to retain it. You can ask us to delete personal information that you believe we no longer are required to retain.
    

You may submit a request to exercise your rights by visiting our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com/) or by emailing us at [trust@clever.com](mailto:trust@clever.com).

We may need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account, if you have one. In certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems, or as permitted by law.

As explained above, if we have collected and use your personal information at the direction of and under the control of a School then you will need to contact the School for any privacy-related requests with respect to that personal information.

**Changes to this Canadian Notice.** Clever may modify or update this Canadian Notice from time to time so you should review this Canadian Notice periodically.
