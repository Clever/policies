# Clever Additional Terms for Parent Accounts

_Effective Date: April 3, 2020_

Welcome to Clever’s Additional Terms for Parent Accounts (the “**Additional Terms for Parent Accounts**”). If you are a parent or guardian (“**Parent**”) who creates a Clever account or otherwise engages with Clever’s School Services, these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts apply to you and, along with our [General Terms of Use](general-terms-of-use.md) and [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md), form our “Agreement” that governs your use of the Services. If you’re a Parent that does not have a Clever account and have not provided your personal information directly to Clever, these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts do not apply to you.

Capitalized terms that are not defined below have the definitions given them in the [General Terms of Use](general-terms-of-use.md).

### SECTION 1. YOUR ACCESS TO THE CLEVER SERVICES

Clever provides data integration and single sign-on functionality, making it easier for Schools to choose, deploy and control software applications made available by Developers that are used by teachers and students in the classroom. Please note this service may not be available for all Schools or Parents.
Depending on the functionality selected by your child’s School, you may receive an invitation to create a Clever account to access School-related content and materials through Clever or to enable a Student’s continued access to the Clever Services outside of the classroom. By creating your Parent account, you represent that you are the parent or guardian of the Student and are authorized to access the Student’s Student Data. Please note that this service may not be available for all Schools or Parents.

### SECTION 2. ACCESS TO STUDENT DATA

Clever takes its responsibility for Student Data very seriously and Clever’s collection, use and disclosure of Student Data is strictly governed by our Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use for Schools, and any other agreement between Clever and a School. The School controls whether and how a Parent can access Student Data through Clever and determines how much Student Data is accessible to Parents through Clever. If you have any questions about accessing, reviewing, modifying, or deleting personal information from your student’s Clever account, or exercising any of your legal rights to access or modify your child’s educational records under FERPA, please contact your School directly.

### SECTION 3. PRIVACY AND SECURITY

Clever is deeply committed to the privacy of our users.  Our collection, use, retention and disclosure of personal information is generally described in our Privacy Policy. The following additional terms apply to Parents that create a parent account or provide personal information to Clever:

**Information we collect.** We collect personal information about Parents provided by the School or teacher (such as a name and email address) as well as any other information you provide to us. For example, when you create a Parent account on the Service or when you sign up for a newsletter or content alerts, we may collect information such as your name, email address, phone number and any information about you or your student you chose to provide when you create your account. If you create an account by logging in through a third party social network or authentication service such as Facebook or Google, these services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information. The data we receive is dependent on that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. We also collect information through technology when you use our Services, as described in our Privacy Policy.

**How we use and disclose your information.** We use your information to provide the features and functionality of the Services available to Parents. From time to time, we may use your information to send you email communications about the Clever Services, including news and updates on new features or services, or communications about products or services we believe you may enjoy. For example, we may recommend or suggest third party educational services you may be interested in. However, we do not use Student Data for targeted advertising or marketing communications, and we do not send marketing communications to student users.  We disclose your personal information in the manner described in Section 2 of our Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted with your consent.

**Modifying or deleting your information.** If you have a Clever account, you may update your account information by signing into your account and modifying your profile and settings. If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, please visit our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us).

We retain your information for the time period reasonably necessary to provide our Services to you.  You control your account information.  If your School terminates its agreement with Clever, or deletes or deactivates a student’s account access, your account will not be impacted, though you will no longer have access to that Student Data. If you would like to delete your personal information, or if you have questions about data retention or deletion, please visit our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us).

**Communications preferences.** From time to time, Clever may send you email communications, such as informational emails about the Clever Services, promotional emails about Clever products or third party services, and communications directly from your child’s School. You may opt-out of receiving promotional or commercial emails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” feature at the bottom of each email. You cannot opt-out or Sorry, you cannot unsubscribe from Service-related messaging or communications that Clever sends on behalf of a School.

You may choose to receive communications through SMS/text message. If you sign up to receive text messages, you may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. If you no longer want to receive such text messages, you may opt out by replying STOP.


**Keeping your information safe.** Clever maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. However, no system is impenetrable. If your information is disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized party, we will promptly take steps to investigate the matter and will notify you in accordance with applicable laws.

### SECTION 4. UPDATES TO THESE ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR PARENT ACCOUNTS

We will update these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts from time to time, particularly as we introduce new functionality that may be available for Parent accounts, so you should review this page periodically. Upon making changes, we will update the “Effective Date” found at the top of this page. If we change these Terms in a material manner, for example if we seek to use personal information in a materially different way than we had previously, we will provide notice of the changes in advance so that you have sufficient time to evaluate the change in practice. Of course, you can always opt-out by deleting your account before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the Services after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.

### SECTION 5. QUESTIONS

We hope you have the best possible experience when using our Services. If you have any questions or concerns about our Services or anything in our General Terms Use, these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts, or our Privacy Policy, please don’t hesitate to contact us by visiting our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us) and we’ll do our best to promptly respond to you.
