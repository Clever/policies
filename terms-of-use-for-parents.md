# Clever Additional Terms for Parent Accounts

_Effective Date: May 22, 2019_

Welcome to Clever’s Additional Terms for Parent Accounts (the “**Additional Terms for Parent Accounts**”). If you are a parent or guardian (“**Parent**”) who creates a Clever account, these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts apply to you and, along with our [General Terms of Use](general-terms-of-use.md) and [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md), form our “Agreement” that governs your use of the Services. If you’re a Parent that does not have a Clever account, these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts do not apply to you.

Capitalized terms that are not defined below have the definitions given them in the [General Terms of Use](general-terms-of-use.md).

### SECTION 1. YOUR ACCESS TO THE CLEVER SERVICES

Clever provides data integration and single sign-on functionality, making it easier for Schools to choose, deploy and control software applications made available by Developers that are used by teachers and students in the classroom.
Depending on the functionality selected by your child’s School, you may receive an invitation to create a Clever account to enable a Student’s continued access to the Clever Services outside of the classroom.  By creating your Parent account, you represent that you are the parent or guardian of the Student and are authorized to access the Student’s Student Data.

### SECTION 2. ACCESS TO STUDENT DATA

Student Data is owned and controlled by the School.  Clever’s use of Student Data is strictly governed by our Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use for Schools, and any other agreement between Clever and a School.  If, and to the extent, your account permits access to Student Data, your access and use of Student Data is subject to the School’s agreement with Clever and the School’s direction and control of student accounts. If you have any questions about accessing, reviewing, modifying, or deleting personal information of a student, or disclosing personal information of a student to a third-party Developer, please contact your School directly.

### SECTION 3. PRIVACY AND SECURITY

Clever is deeply committed to the privacy of our users.  Our collection, use, retention and disclosure of personal information is generally described in our Privacy Policy. The following additional terms apply to Parents that create a parent account:

**Information we collect.** We collect personal information about Parents provided by the School or teacher (such as a name and email address) as well as any other information you provide to us when you create your account.  We also collect information through technology when you use our Services, as described in our Privacy Policy.

**How we use and disclose your information.** We use your information to provide the features and functionality of the Services available to Parents. From time to time, we may use your information to send you email communications about the Clever Services, including news and updates on new features or services, or communications about products or services we believe you may enjoy. For example, we may recommend or suggest a third party educational application that we believe you or your child may enjoy. However, we will never use Student Data for targeted advertising purposes.  We disclose your personal information in the manner described in Section 2 of our Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted with your consent.

**Your choices about your information.** You may update your account information by signing into your account and modifying your profile and settings. You may opt-out of receiving promotional or commercial emails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” feature at the bottom of each email. Sorry, you cannot unsubscribe from Service-related messaging. If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, please visit our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us).

**How long we keep your information and content.** We retain your information for the time period reasonably necessary to provide our Services to you.  You control your account information.  If your School terminates its agreement with Clever, or deletes or deactivates a student’s account access, your account will not be impacted, though you will no longer have access to that Student Data. If you would like to delete your personal information, or if you have questions about data retention or deletion, please visit our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us).

**Keeping your information safe.** Clever maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. However, no system is impenetrable. If your information is disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized party, we will promptly take steps to investigate the matter and will notify you in accordance with applicable laws.

### SECTION 4. UPDATES TO THESE ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR PARENT ACCOUNTS

We will update these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts from time to time, particularly as we introduce new functionality that may be available for Parent accounts, so you should review this page periodically. Upon making changes, we will update the “Effective Date” found at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Services after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.

### SECTION 5. QUESTIONS

We hope you have the best possible experience when using our Services. If you have any questions or concerns about our Services or anything in our General Terms Use, these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts, or our Privacy Policy, please don’t hesitate to contact us by visiting our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us) and we’ll do our best to promptly respond to you.
