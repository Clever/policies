Clever Terms and Policies
=========================

This repository contains the various terms and policies used by [Clever](https://clever.com) providing a historical record of changes and planned future changes.

HOWTO: Open source your company's policies
==========================================
1. [Create your own repository](https://github.com/new) named *policies* or [fork ours](https://github.com/clever/policies#fork-destination-box).

2. Add your current policies to the repository:
  - Include your Terms of Service, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other policy documents that relate to schools, students, and teachers using your service.
  - Protip: The [HTML to Markdown](https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/) converter makes it easy to generate plain text versions of your existing policies.

3. Use [Git branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) and [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to manage changes in your policies.

4. Let everyone know by tweeting your repository with the hashtag [#opensourceprivacy](https://twitter.com/search?q=opensourceprivacy&src=typd) and request addition to [PrivacyByChoice](http://privacybychoice.github.io/) page.

As of June 2022, we NO longer updating this repo to reflect changes made to the Clever Privacy Policy. Instead, we are maintaining the change log history via this [page](https://clever.com/trust/privacy/change-history), and the respective privacy-change-history HTML file in the **website** repo will be the sole source of truth for changes.
