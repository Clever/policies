These data privacy and usage terms (the “**Universal Data Sharing Agreement**”) apply to all: (i) schools, school districts, and related organizations (collectively, the “**School**”) that use the Clever Platform (as defined below) to procure the rights to use the education related applications and services provided by Developers (the “**Developer Product(s)**”); and (ii) providers of Developer Products (each a “**Developer**”).

The purpose of this Universal Data Sharing Agreement is to describe the duties and responsibilities to protect Student Data (as defined below) transmitted by School to Developer pursuant to the Agreement (as defined below), including compliance with Privacy Laws (as defined below).

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN SCHOOL AND DEVELOPER.** School and the Developer are collectively the parties to this Universal Data Sharing Agreement (the “**Parties**”). School and Developer each acknowledge and agree that Clever, Inc. (“**Clever**”) is not a party to the Agreement and will have no liability to any party hereunder.

If you are procuring or providing Developer Products via the Clever Platform on behalf of a company, entity, or organization then you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of School procuring, or Developer providing, the Developer Products with the authority to bind such organization to these terms, and that you agree to these terms on behalf of such organization.

For Schools: By checking the box marked [“I Agree”] (or, the procurement of a Developer Product on the Clever Platform, School otherwise affirmatively states the desire to procure the Developer Product), School signifies that it has read, understood, and agrees to be bound by this Universal Data Sharing Agreement, otherwise School may not use the Developer Product.

For Developers: By signing and agreeing to the Developer Addendum for the Clever Universal Data Sharing Agreement, Developer signifies that it has read, understood, and agrees to be bound by this Universal Data Sharing Agreement with each School that utilizes the Clever Platform to procure a Developer Product(s), otherwise Developer may not make its Developer Product(s) available on the Clever Platform.

This Universal Data Sharing Agreement is hereby attached to and incorporated into the Developer Terms that were entered into between School and Developer when School checked the box marked [“I Agree”] to affirm acceptance of the Developer Terms or by any other agreement between the Parties for the provision of the Developer Product (the “**Developer Terms**”). The Developer Terms, this Universal Data Sharing Agreement and any other agreement between the Parties for the provision of the Developer Product are collectively referred to hereinafter as the “**Agreement**.”  Clever will notify the Parties via email in advance of any material changes to this Universal Data Sharing Agreement. Upon making changes, Clever will update the “Last Modified Date” found at the top of this page.  For School, continued use of the Developer Product, and for Developer, continued provision of the Developer Product via the Clever Platform, after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## 6. MISCELLANEOUS

**6.1 Term.**  The Parties will be bound by the provisions of this Universal Data Sharing Agreement for the duration of the Agreement or so long as the Developer maintains Student Data.

**6.2 Limitation of Liability.** Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties in writing, the limitation of liability provision set forth in the Developer Terms or any other agreement between the Parties will govern this Universal Data Sharing Agreement.

**6.3 Priority of Agreements.**  This Universal Data Sharing Agreement will govern the treatment of Student Data in order to comply with Privacy Laws. In the event there is conflict between the terms of this Universal Data Sharing Agreement and the Developer Terms or other document, bid, RFP, or writing, the terms of this Universal Data Sharing Agreement will govern and take precedence to the extent of the conflict. Except as described in this paragraph herein, all other provisions of the Agreement will remain in effect including provisions establishing governing law and venue in the Developer Terms or any other agreement between the Parties, which the Parties mutually agree will take precedence over the Developer Terms.

**6.4 Severability.**  Any provision of this Universal Data Sharing Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Universal Data Sharing Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction while, at the same time, maintaining the intent of the parties, it will, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Universal Data Sharing Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
