# Clever's Commitment to Your Privacy

Clever (“Clever,” “we,” or “us”) understands that privacy is tremendously important to our online visitors to our website (“Website Visitors”), to schools who register for our Service (“Schools”), and to students whose information we may access on behalf of a School (“Students”). Clever provides a platform that enables Schools to securely provision the accounts for their third-party applications, and for students and teachers to easily log in to those accounts.  As we describe below, Schools decide which data are integrated with Clever, and Schools are responsible for determining whether data are ever shared with applications through Clever. This privacy policy applies to our website [https://clever.com](https://clever.com) and to the Clever platform (our “Service”) and describes the steps we take to protect your data.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Use](https://clever.com/about/terms).

## _We strive to be transparent in our data collection and use practices. This is the type of personal information we may collect about you._

### 1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION

We collect the following types of information:

**Information about Schools:** We ask for certain information when a School administrator registers a School with Clever, or if the administrator corresponds with us online, which may include a name, school name, school district name, school email address and/or account name and password, phone number, message content, and information relating to the School’s information systems.  We may also retain information provided by a School if the School sends us a message, posts content to our website or through our Service, or responds to emails or surveys. Once a School begins using the Clever Service, we will keep records of activities related to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to the features and functionality of the Service, to monitor our Service offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our Schools and website visitors.

**Student Data:** Clever may have access to personally identifiable information about students (“Student Data”) in the course of providing its services to a School. We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide the services on the School’s behalf. In many instances, Clever receives Student Data only from the School and never interacts with the Student directly.  In some instances, depending on the level of Clever’s Service selected by the School, the Schools may allow Students to log into the Clever Service to access third party applications that have been authorized by the School. In that instance, School provides each student with login credentials and confirms that it has obtained appropriate parental consents, as needed, before the student is permitted to access the Service.

Clever has access to Student Data only as requested by the School and only for the purposes of performing Services on the School’s behalf.  If you are a Student or parent, please contact your School if you have questions about the School’s use of technology service providers like Clever.

See [How We Share Information](https://clever.com/about/privacy-policy#how_we_share_information) below for more information on the limited ways in which we share School and Student Data.  See [Children’s Privacy](https://clever.com/about/privacy-policy#childrens-privacy) below for more information on how we collect and use the personal information of children under 13.

**Information collected through technology:** We automatically collect certain types of usage information when visitors view our website or use our service. We may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Clever help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file information from your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Schools to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. <u>We do not allow third party advertising networks to collect information about the users of our Site or Service.</u>

We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log files, device identifiers, and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that a user will not have to re-enter it during subsequent visits; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and usage on our website and our Service; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) help users efficiently access information after signing in. 

## _Student privacy is very important to us. Student Data are used only for educational purposes at the discretion of the School._

### 2. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION

Clever only shares personal information in a few limited circumstances, described below.  We do not rent or sell information for marketing purposes.

**Who we may share information with:**

*   We may share information with those that provide us with technology services (e.g. web hosting and analytics services), but strictly for the purpose of carrying out their work for us.
*   We may be required to share information with law enforcement or other third parties when compelled to do so by court order or other legal process, to comply with statutes or regulations, to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://clever.com/about/terms/), or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users.
*   In the event of a change of control: If we sell, divest or transfer the business or a portion of our business, we may transfer information, provided that the new provider has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own. We may also transfer personal information – under the same conditions – in the course of mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of our business.

**How Student Data are shared:** In addition to the actions described above, Clever may facilitate the sharing of Student Data with third parties, though only when instructed and authorized to do so on behalf of the School. Some elements of our Service enable Schools to interact with parents, students, teachers and third party applications, for the benefit of the student’s education. Clever does not facilitate the sharing of any Student Data with third parties on the Service except on behalf of the School after the School has authorized a third party or application to access Student Data through the Service.

## _We store our data in the United States and we take strong measures to keep data safe and secure._

### 3. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

**Storage and processing:** Any information collected through the Service is stored and processed in the United States. If you use our Service outside of the United States, you consent to have your data transferred to the United States.

**Keeping your information safe:**  Clever maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two factor authentication) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.

How long we keep User Content: Following termination or deactivation of a School account, Clever may retain profile information and content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes, but any and all Student Data associated with the School will be deleted promptly.  We may maintain anonymized or aggregated data, including usage data, for analytics purposes. If you have any questions about data retention or deletion, please contact [support@clever.com](mailto:support@clever.com).

## _We do not collect any information from students._

### 5. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Clever does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 unless the School has obtained appropriate parental consent for the student to use the Service. Please contact us at [urgent@clever.com](mailto:urgent@clever.com) if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under 13 without proper parental consents so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.

### 6. LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES
