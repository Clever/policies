Cookie Notice
=============

Clever provides a platform that enables Schools to securely provision the accounts with the third party applications that they use. This cookie notice ("Cookie Notice") explains how we use cookies and similar technologies in the course of our business, including through our website [https://clever.com/](/) ("Website") and the Clever platform ("Platform"), which we refer to collectively as our "Services". Cookies help us to provide you with a positive user experience and allows us to provide and improve our Services. If you have any questions or concerns about this Cookie Notice, please contact us using the details provided at the bottom of this page.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Cookie Notice have the meaning given to them in our [Terms of Use](/trust/terms).

In some cases we may use cookies and similar technologies described in this Cookie Notice to collect personal information, or to collect information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. For more information about how we process your personal information, please read our [Privacy Policy](/trust/privacy/policy/).

### 1\. WHAT ARE COOKIES

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use a service online. Cookies are widely used by online providers to make their websites or services work, or work more efficiently, as well as to create reporting information.

Cookies set by the online provider (in this case, Clever) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the online provider are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service that you are using (such as interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer or device both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.

Cookies that expire at the end of a browser session (normally when you exit your browser) are called "session cookies". Session cookies can be used to recognize and link your actions during a single browsing session. Cookies that can be stored for longer are called "persistent cookies", and can be used to remember your preferences or actions on the website or service that you are using.

  

### 2\. HOW WE USE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Services to work, and we refer to these as "strictly necessary" cookies. Some cookies measure traffic and statistical data about usage of our Services, which we use to understand how our Services are being used, and we refer to these as "performance" cookies. Other cookies enable us to personalize your experience or otherwise improve the functionality of the Services, and we refer to these as "functionality" cookies. Finally, we also use cookies to personalize content for you and make advertising and marketing messages more relevant to you, and we refer to these as "targeting" cookies.

**Other tracking technologies:** We and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, software development kit (SDKs), pixels (or "clear gifs") and other tracking technologies. Pixels are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Services or, in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Services to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. We also use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as local storage objects, for similar purposes as cookies. Local storage objects enable the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair the functionality of these technologies. Your web browser may also provide functionality to clear your browser web storage, see Section 5 below for more information.

**We never use targeting cookies on our Platform aimed at Students. For Students using our Platform, we only use strictly necessary cookies and limited performance and functionality cookies in order to provide our Services to Users.**

  

### 3\. COOKIES WE SERVE THROUGH OUR SERVICES

### 4\. TARGETING COOKIES

We (and third-party service providers that we work with) may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our website and/or services, to gain insights into how you are using our Services. We use this information for our marketing purposes in order to suggest products or features that you may be interested in or, in some cases, to deliver advertisements to you that are more tailored based on your browsing activities and inferred interests. We may also use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your visits to our Services to measure and track the effectiveness of our marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). You can opt out from the use of targeting cookies using the methods described in Section 5 below.

**We never use targeting cookies on our service aimed at Students.**

### 5\. HOW TO CONTROL COOKIES AND SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.

**Cookie preference center:** You can exercise preferences about what cookies are served through our Services by visiting our Cookie Preference Center.

**Browser controls:** If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. You may wish to refer to [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html) for information on commonly used browsers. If you want to change your settings (for example, if you accept all cookies but later decide you do not want a certain type of cookie), you will need to use your browser settings to remove any cookies dropped on your previous visit. Please note that disabling cookies may negatively impact your experience using the Services, as some features and services on our Services may not work properly.

**Third-party cookies:** In addition to managing cookies through the methods described above, you can also opt out of certain third-party cookies. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how people use our Services and compile reporting information. These reports disclose trends without identifying individual users and ultimately help us to understand how to further improve the experience on the Services. You can opt out of these cookies without affecting your use of the Services. For more information on Google Analytics, see [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). If you donâ€™t want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can also install the [Google Analytics browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en). For information about how to opt out of other third-party cookies, please refer to the entries for those third parties above.

**Do not track:** Some browsers include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time. We take privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

  

### 6\. EDTECH ANALYTICS

Clever has developed a proprietary analytics service ("Edtech Analytics") that collects analytics and statistical analysis related to the use of educational websites, applications and services by students and teachers. While this service does not use cookie and similar technologies, it does collect data using a browser extension. This includes information such as URL, time spent on page, use of third party educational websites and applications, unique device ID, browser version, and similar data. Clever provides this service for our customers, who are responsible for installing and configuring the service. You can find out more about Edtech Analytics [here](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360039420391?language=en_US).
