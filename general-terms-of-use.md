# Clever General Terms of Use

_Effective Date: Jan 6, 2017_

Welcome to Clever! We’re delighted to have you on our website and maybe even using our service (the “Services”). Please continue reading to learn about the terms by which you may use our Services. If you have questions about this Agreement, please contact us at [support@clever.com](mailto:support@clever.com).

These General Terms of Use apply to all: (i) schools, school districts, and related entities and organizations that sign up to use the Services, including but not limited to administrators who access the Services on their behalf (each a “School”); (ii) non-School visitors, users, and others, including students, teachers, and their parents, who use the Services; and (iii) third-party providers of applications (each a “Developer” and collectively with  the individuals referenced in (ii) above and Schools, the “Users” or “you”). If you’re a School, our [Additional Terms of Use for Schools](terms-of-use-for-schools.md) apply to you too. If you’re a Developer, our [Additional Terms of Use for Developers](terms-of-use-for-developers.md) apply to you too. These General Terms of Use, the [Additional Terms of Use for Schools](terms-of-use-for-schools.md) (as applicable to Schools) and the [Additional Terms of Use for Developers](terms-of-use-for-developers.md) (as applicable to Developers) are collectively referred to herein as the “Agreement”.

By accessing or using the Services, checking the box marked [“I Agree”], or by otherwise affirmatively stating your desire to use the Services, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the [Clever Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md), otherwise you may not use the Services. Because our Services change relatively often, the terms in this Agreement and our Privacy Policy may change too. If you are a School or Developer using the Services, we will notify you via email in advance of any material changes to the terms. Upon making changes, we will update the “Effective Date” found at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Services after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.

### SECTION 1. WHAT ARE CLEVER’S SERVICES AND WHO CAN USE THEM?

What do we do? We provide Schools both data integration and single sign-on functionality, making it easier for Schools to choose, deploy, and control software applications made available by Developers that are used by their teachers and students.

You’re allowed to use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Clever, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. If you’ve been removed from the Services previously, you’re not allowed to use them again.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Clever grants to you permission to access and use the Services. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in the Services and the Clever Content (as defined below). We may terminate this license at any time for any or no reason.

**i) DETAILS ABOUT THE CLEVER SERVICES**

Your Clever account gives you access to our Services, but don’t sign up on behalf of a School if you do not have the requisite authority to do so. Once you sign up, you are responsible for your account and any data associated with it.

Your Clever account gives you access to the Services and functionality we make available from time to time and at our discretion, which may include single sign-on capability for certain applications made available by Developers. We maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Clever account on behalf of a School or a Developer, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf.

Remember: you are responsible for any activity that occurs on your account, you may never use someone else’s account without permission, and you must keep your account password secure. We recommend using “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols, and are not reused with any other service) with your account to avoid unauthorized use. Please let us know immediately if you think your account’s security has been compromised so we can help; we are not liable for any losses of any kind caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

**ii) WHAT CONTROL DO I HAVE OVER MY USE OF THE SERVICES?**

You may control your profile and how you interact with the Services by changing the settings in your [settings page](https://account.clever.com/settings). By providing your email address to us you consent to our using the email address to send you Services-related notices, including any required legal notices and other messages, such as additions or changes to the Services and/or notices of product offers. You may opt out or change your preferences in your [settings page](https://account.clever.com/settings). While we need your email address to send you important Services-related notices, you can always ask us to stop sending you certain marketing messages. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

**iii) RESTRICTED USES**

Please don’t do anything to harm our product or try to hack our service. Specifically, by using the Services, you agree not to do any of these things: (i) copy, distribute, or disclose any part of the Services in any medium, including but not limited to by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) use any automated system, including but not limited to “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Services in a manner that sends more request messages to the Clever servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional online web browser; (iii) transmit spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempt to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Services; (v) take any action that imposes, or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) transmit any malicious software agents through the Services; (vii) collect or harvest any third-party personally identifiable information, including account names or Student Data (as defined below), from the Services; (viii) use the Services for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonate another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfere with the proper working of the Services; (xi) access any content on the Services through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Services; or (xii) bypass the measures we use to prevent or restrict access to the Services, including but not limited to features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Services or related content.

We continually update our Services to offer the best possible product. While we plan to continue to offer and improve our Services, we may, without prior notice, change, cancel, create usage limits for, or permanently or temporarily stop offering or allowing you access to the Services generally (“Service Changes”). While we’ll try to give you advance notice of Service Changes that will adversely affect you, this might not be practical or possible and we retain the right to make Service Changes without notice and liability for any reason. If this Agreement ends you continue to be bound by it in any interactions you may have with the Services.

You are fully responsible for your interactions with other Users, and we have no liability for your interactions with any other Users, or for any User’s actions or inactions with respect to you.

### SECTION 2. RIGHTS IN OUR CONTENT

“Student Data” is any information (in any format) that is directly related to any identifiable current or former student that is maintained by a School, and may include “educational records” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) that Schools provide to us. While we may need to access Student Data to provide the Services to you, Schools own the Student Data and remain responsible for it. Our [Additional Terms of Use for Schools](terms-of-use-for-schools.md), [Additional Terms of Use for Developers](terms-of-use-for-developers.md), and [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md) provide more detail around how we handle Student Data.

“Intellectual Property Rights” means all worldwide patent rights, copyright rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all related applications and registrations, renewals and extensions.

Except for Student Data or the applications made available by Developers, the Services and all materials made available to you in connection with them, including, but not limited to, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and any content belonging to other Users (the “Clever Content”), and all related Intellectual Property Rights, are the exclusive property of Clever and its licensors. Except as specified in this Agreement, nothing may be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any Clever Content. _To be clear: any use of the Clever Content for a purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited_.

If you send us ideas or comments about our Services, you agree that we may freely use or reference those ideas and comments and we do not owe you any payment or have any other obligation of any kind for such ideas or comments.

### SECTION 3. GENERAL LEGAL TERMS

**i) CLEVER DATA**

Certain parts of the Services may allow you to obtain or access analytics or other data or information associated with your account (“Clever Data”). Clever Data is licensed to you for your use on a limited basis, and is governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and available for distribution only at our sole discretion. Clever owns the account you use to access the Services along with any rights of access or rights to data stored by or on behalf of Clever on Clever servers (except with respect to any Student Data that we may be storing for you), including but not limited to any data representing any or all of your Clever Data. Clever has the right to manage, control and even eliminate Clever Data, except that Clever may only use Student Data as specifically permitted by this Agreement.

This next sentence is in all caps because it’s important: YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DATA, ACCOUNT HISTORY AND ACCOUNT CONTENT RESIDING ON CLEVER’S SERVERS MAY BE DELETED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON IN CLEVER’S SOLE DISCRETION, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND. WE DO NOT PROVIDE OR GUARANTEE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, ANY VALUE, CASH OR OTHERWISE, ATTRIBUTED TO ANY DATA RESIDING ON CLEVER’S SERVERS.  IF YOU’RE A SCHOOL, YOU SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY SURE TO KEEP SECURE COPIES OF STUDENT DATA IN YOUR STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (“SIS”) OR IN OTHER SECURE STORAGE. YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON US TO PROVIDE COPIES OF OR ACCESS TO YOUR STUDENT DATA.

**ii) PRIVACY AND SECURITY**

We take very seriously the privacy of our users, including schools, teachers, parents, and students. By using the Services you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information (including but not limited to Student Data) as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md) and, if you’re a School, in the [Additional Terms of Use for Schools](terms-of-use-for-schools.md), and to have your information (including but not limited to Student Data) collected, used, transferred to and processed in the United States pursuant to our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

**iii) THIRD-PARTY SERVICES**

Our website may contain links to third-party websites, services (including but not limited to applications made available by Developers), or other materials or information that are not owned or controlled by us. Keep in mind that we do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services (including but not limited to applications made available by Developers). If you access a third party website or application made available by Developers from the Services, you understand that you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement, the [Additional Terms of Use for Schools](terms-of-use-for-schools.md), [Additional Terms of Use for Developers](terms-of-use-for-developers.md), and our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md) do not apply to your use of those sites or services—those sites and services have their own applicable terms and policies. Additionally, your dealings with Developers found on the Services, including payment, use of your Student Data by the Developers, and any other terms (such as warranties or privacy policies) are only between you and such Developers. We are not responsible for any loss or damage of any sort relating to your dealings with such Developers.

**iv) INDEMNITY**

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Clever and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Services, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement, including but not limited to your breach of any of the representations and warranties; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including but not limited to any right of privacy or Intellectual Property Rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation, including but not limited to FERPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“PPRA”), and the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”); (v) any content or information that is submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party’s access and use of the Services with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.

**v) WARRANTY DISCLAIMER**

These next few sections are in all caps so we can be sure we have your attention. Again, please feel free to contact us at [support@clever.com](mailto:support@clever.com) if any of this is unclear or if you have any questions about what these sections mean.

FEDERAL LAW, SOME STATES, PROVINCES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF CERTAIN IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**vi) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CLEVER, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THIS SERVICES.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF CLEVER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

The Services are controlled and operated from US-based facilities, and we make no representations that they’re appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you access or use the Services from other jurisdictions, you understand that you’re entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. Because we have to say this, you may not use the Services if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.

**vii) GOVERNING LAW**

You agree that: (i) the Services will be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Services will be deemed passive services that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions related to this Agreement.

**viii) MISCELLANEOUS**

This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us in accordance with the terms of our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md). This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Clever in connection with the Services including other agreements referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and Clever concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Clever’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If access to the Services is licensed to the United States government or any agency thereof, then the Services will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” pursuant to DFARS Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, respectively, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the Services and any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by this Agreement and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement. Neither party will hold themselves out to be joint venturers, and neither party is authorized or empowered to act as the agent of the other.
