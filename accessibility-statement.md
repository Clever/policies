### Accessibility statement for Clever’s student portal ###

Good things happen when K-12 students easily log in and learn. That’s why Clever is committed to making technology accessible to schools, educators, and students. We prioritize digital accessibility for all of our users, including people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience of Clever's student portal for everyone, and we always keep accessibility standards top-of-mind.

### Measures to support accessibility ###

Clever takes the following measures to ensure Clever is accessible for all students:

*  Include accessibility throughout our internal policies.
*  Provide continual accessibility training for our staff.
*  Assign clear accessibility targets and responsibilities.
*  Perform regular accessibility audits.

### Conformance status ###

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. As we release new features, we are committed to making improvements to Clever’s student experience based on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (2.0, AA level).

Clever’s products are continuously refined to support students with the following impairments:

*  Sight — low vision, blindness, colorblindness
*  Hearing — deaf, hard of hearing
*  Motor — physical limitations, slow movements, epilepsy
*  Cognitive — cognitive delays, learning disabilities, problems with concentration


### Additional accessibility considerations ###

[Clever Badges](https://clever.com/products/badges), a tool that’s part of Clever’s no-cost SSO solution, gives all students a unique and fun way to log in to their learning software—no typing necessary. Clever Badges provide support for students who have motor impairments or difficulty typing to access their online resources through Clever.
